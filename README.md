The analysis script is plot_temp_scan.py

To run it all you need to do is create a conda environment with pyplot, numpy, and scipy and run "python plot_temp_scan.py"

This runs the analysis for W3045, W3056, and the AC-LGAD for the thresholds defined in line 470. One can comment this line and uncomment 469 to run the full code that indentifies the ideal threshold for each sensor
